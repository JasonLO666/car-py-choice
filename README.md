# car-py-choice
# This is about my autocar project
 This is an unmanned vehicle developed based on ROS, equipped with a lidar, camera, gyroscope, TCP, motor driver, etc. I've set up Publishers and Subscribers, and some parts use callback functions to execute corresponding functionalities. I've extracted a portion of the code related to Python and named it "car-py-choice". If anyone has any questions, feel free to contact me at Jasonlo0490@163.com.
